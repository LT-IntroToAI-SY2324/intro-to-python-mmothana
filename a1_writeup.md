# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

My initial thoughts about the python programming language is that it's different and more complex than java. It uses more words than java. I still like python but it'll take time to get used to after getting used to java all of last school year.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Similarities between python and java is that they both use the same elements with lists, for loops, while loops, if and else. So they both still do the same thing but just in different ways. The difference is the language itself and how its written, you have to use ; after most lines or the program won't work while in python you rarely see ;. I also see more words and more spaces in python while I don't see as many in java.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

A thing I learned through this assignment is just how to write and work python. I've already done problems similar to the ones in a1.py in java but I have to try to solve them in python which is still a challenge to me.
